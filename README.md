# Controller

The controller is a floating panel which reproduces widget inputs from all the red nodes in your workflow. That's pretty much it.

So you can use Comfy with it looking like this:

When the workflow really looks like this:

## How to use

- Install the custom node
```
cd custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/chrisgoringe/cg-controller
```
- Set the nodes in your workflow you want to see the widgets from to be red
- Right-click the canvas and select 'Show Controller Panel'

## Options

In the main comfy menu there are some options:

### Show control after generate

By default the control_after_generate widget (attached to seeds and int primitives) is hidden. You can choose to show it.

### Toggle controller visibility

You can choose one of four keyboard shortcuts to make the controller appear or disappear, or set it to none. Default is `c`.

### Sliders

Options to replace numeric fields with slider inputs. Three choices

- `No`
- `When exact`
- `When possible`

A slider input is calibrated in 200 steps, so if the range of values divided by the precision (for floats) is greater than 200, a slider cannot be exact. `When possible` will use a slider anyway.

It's quite common for a numeric value not to be shown as a slider if you use `When exact`. If you change to `When possible` you might find it becomes a slider, but isn't usable because of the range of values (for instance, a slider for steps that goes from 0 to 2048 isn't much use).

In the settings menu you will find three controls, `Override step size`, `Override min values` and `Override max values`. Each of these has the same format, which is a comma separated list of overrides, each of which is either `widget_name=value` (applies to all matching widgets) or `node_name:widget_name=value` (only applies if both node and widget names match).

Using `Override max values` (and maybe `Override min values`) will allow you to make the sliders a lot more usable in `When possible` mode; using `Override step size` 
can make sliders appear in `When exact` mode. 

The definition used for `When exact` is `(max-min)/step <= 200`

## Anything else?

- You can make nodes brown to designate them as advanced controls
- If you change colors or widgets or names, use the 'Update Controller Panel' canvas menu (to be fixed  - issue #34)
- To update the controller code (if you haven't added it via the manager)
```
cd custom_nodes/cg-controller
git pull
```
